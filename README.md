[Safa Notes]

Login compenent works with a csv file. The path hard coded in Loginpage class. You can set up with your computer. Basically, I added three lines in csv file. I am adding this file to project file directory. You can copy in your computer. (That would be different in windows and mac.)

I also will change mainUI implementation in meeting. I already made them but that's not  useful for development step. (You need to delivariable1 everytime to see mainUI)
